# Course Syllabus: INFO 6250 - Silicon Valley
# Fall Semester 2024 - Thu
Instructor: Brett Ritter `<b.ritter@neu.edu>`

This course covers Web Development, focusing on both the fundamentals and from them modern development practices for the web.  The class will use Javascript on both the front- and back-ends of web application development, but the lessons learned will be applicable to many languages.  
 - Basic git use as a version control system for shared applications and development
 - How information flows in a web application between various machines
 - Modern JS development for the frontend (both "vanilla" JS and React-based)
 - NodeJS development of a backend end, both server generated content using the express framework (minimal) and service development
 - Basic Debugging Techniques
 - Web security fundamental practices, both front- and back-end.
 - The basics of how many development teams breakdown application needs and complete work

### What is NOT covered
 - How to program in general
 - HTML and CSS details (My INFO6150 course is a great source of info here)
 - Languages other than Javascript (focus is on concepts)
 - Mobile specific development
 - Accessibility (a11y), Internationalization (i18n), or Localization (l10n)
 - SQL/NoSQL usage or database architectures/maintenance
 - Specific Libraries: Focus is on concepts and not the diverse but temporary library options
